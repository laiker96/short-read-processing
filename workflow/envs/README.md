# Rule environments

These files define isolated tool groups for Snakemake rules. With the local
profile, Snakemake creates resolved environments under `.snakemake/conda` in the
repository root. Do not create them as named environments in Mamba's global
environment directory.

- `read_qc.yaml`: raw/trimmed FASTQ QC and adapter trimming
- `alignment.yaml`: short-read alignment and BAM filtering
- `peaks.yaml`: MACS3 callpeak, bdgcmp/qpois, and HMMRATAC
- `atac_qc.yaml`: Tn5 insertion preparation, qpois refinement, BigWigs, and ATAC QC
- `chip_qc.yaml`: R-based ChIP cross-correlation QC only
- `reporting.yaml`: MultiQC aggregation
