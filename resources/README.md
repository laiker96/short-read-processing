# Pipeline resources

This directory contains only versioned inputs needed to reproduce the dm6 atlas
runs and the adapter sequences used by the workflow.

## Atlas inputs

- `atlas_samples_ip_only.tsv`: minimal four-column pipeline input with 23 ATAC
  accession rows and 15 H3K27ac IP rows. It contains no input-DNA libraries.
- `atlas_samples_with_inputs.tsv`: alternative combined input containing the
  same ATAC selection and 15 H3K27ac IPs, with matched inputs for the two
  GSE140539 stage-5 IPs and the selected adult-brain IP. Other H3K27ac contexts
  remain IP-only because no suitable matched input is included.

These two reviewed tables are the versioned pipeline inputs. Detailed dataset
selection and QC metadata belong to the separate atlas-analysis repository and
are not required by this accession-processing workflow.

Both tables use the default two-ended Tn5/MACS3-qpois ATAC branch. The
with-inputs table deliberately substitutes the matched GSE140539 stage-5
H3K27ac IPs for the IP-only PRJEB37091 stage-5 pair; it is an alternative
scientific selection, not merely the IP-only table plus control rows.
The encoded matched pairs are GSE140539 stage-5 IP/input runs
`SRR10485675/SRR10485676` and `SRR10485677/SRR10485678`, plus adult-brain
`SRR5319052/SRR5319047`.

## Adapter sequences

The 158 sequence records in `adapters/adapters.fa` come from
`BBMap_39.96.tar.gz:bbmap/resources/adapters.fa` in the parent workspace.

- BBMap archive SHA-256: `e173bdd0d3ca047f378c71dad568a148596c1690bf36abca93e918569c9fb382`
- Upstream extracted FASTA SHA-256: `85abe9d3e40dc37c968f7e4c1227e05976a4ed0583d1dd442d375aa7516f13a9`
- Repository FASTA SHA-256: `74e19a3b2b09f8fa84bf2e59877f025591bfe64fb50fcb8ee6169631ccb58468`
- Records: 158

The complete file contains TruSeq, Nextera, and other sequences. It must not be
passed wholesale to Cutadapt as though all 158 entries were equivalent 3-prime
adapters.

The reviewed `adapters/nextera.fa` and `adapters/truseq.fa` subsets contain the
read-through sequences associated with the named workflow presets. The full
BBMap collection is retained for provenance and custom adapter review.
